# A Digital Service Manual for Defence

Welcome to the Ministry of Defence's Digital Service Manual! 

## Who is this for?

The **Digital Service Manual for Defence** is primarily for teams delivering products and services within the Ministry of Defence. The aim is to make it as easy as possible for those teams to do the right things in the right way. 

It may also be useful as a reference for those teams' stakeholders, who may wish to understand what they're doing, why, and how. 

## What this is and what it isn't

This manual will *not* describe how a multi-disciplinary delivery team should generally go about their business (for example, how to carry out user research), as this is covered in the [GOV.UK Service Manual][1] and the [Technology Code of Practice][2]. 

Instead, you'll find additional, supplementary information that helps a delivery team to understand how to do what's described in the [GOV.UK Service Manual][1] within a Defence context. 

For example, the [Service Manual][1] explains that you should form a multi-disciplinary team and this Defence manual will explain the processes (e.g. Finance and Commercial) that you can go through to do so.
