# A Digital Service Manual for Defence

## What is this?

Welcome to the Defence Digital Service Manual! 

This manual is all about explaining how to develop digital products and services in Defence, in such a way that meets best practices and mandated standards. To that end, it's structured around things like the [GOV.UK Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual) and the [Technology Code of Practice](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/technology-code-of-practice/technology-code-of-practice). 

The idea is to make it as easy as possible for delivery teams to do the right things in the right way. We hope to be able to remove the need for teams to search around the intranet, SharePoint, etc. for the policies and processes that relate to product/service design and delivery by explaining and linking out from this manual. 

## Who is it for?

Primarily, this is for service/product delivery teams to make their lives easier when navigating the practices and processes in Defence that lead to a successful product/service being delivered in such a way that is most valuable to users as possible. 

It may also be useful for stakeholders of those delivery teams, to understand what they're doing, and why and how they're doing it. 

## Contributing to the manual

Part of this manual (this bit) is open source and part is a bit more sensitive (and therefore not open source). Anybody can raise issues and pull requests in the public repository and these will be reviewed as we have time (no time promises, unfortunately). 

If you are internal to the Ministry of Defence and would like to make changes to the closed-source sections of the manual, please email hello@digital.mod.uk from your MOD email address, indicating in the subject that you're requesting access, and including your GitHub username in the body.
